## About Linux

Linux is an open-source, Unix-like operating system kernel that serves as the foundation for various distributions (distros) such as Ubuntu, Fedora, and Debian. It is known for its stability, security, and flexibility, making it widely used in servers, embedded systems, and personal computers. Linux supports multi-user environments, offers powerful command-line tools, and is highly customizable. It is maintained by a global community of developers and is available for free under the GNU General Public License (GPL).

## GNU, Kernel and Linux

- **Linux**: A free and open-source operating system kernel developed by **Linus Torvalds** in 1991. It serves as the core of many operating systems.
- **Kernel**: The central part of an operating system that manages hardware and system resources. Linux is a type of kernel.
- **GNU**: A free software project started by **Richard Stallman** in 1983 to create a Unix-like operating system. Many GNU tools and utilities are used alongside the Linux kernel to form a complete operating system, often called GNU/Linux.

In short, **Linux (the kernel) + GNU tools = a functional operating system (GNU/Linux)**.

## Shell

A shell is a command-line interface (CLI) that allows users to interact with the operating system by executing commands. It acts as a bridge between the user and the system’s kernel.

### Types of Shells

There are several types of shells in Linux, including:

- **Bash (Bourne Again Shell)** – The most common and default shell in many Linux distributions.
- **Sh (Bourne Shell)** – The original Unix shell, simpler than Bash.
- **Zsh (Z Shell)** – An advanced shell with powerful features like auto-completion and plugins.
- **Fish (Friendly Interactive Shell)** – A user-friendly shell with syntax highlighting and suggestions.
- **Csh (C Shell)** – A shell with a C-like syntax, commonly used in scripting.
- **Tcsh** – An improved version of Csh, adding more features.

## Terminal

A terminal is an application that provides access to the shell. It allows users to enter commands and see their output. Examples include:

- **GNOME Terminal** (for GNOME desktops)
- **Konsole** (for KDE desktops)
- **xterm**
- **Alacritty**
- **Terminator**

In short, the **terminal** is the interface, and the **shell** is the program that processes commands within it.
